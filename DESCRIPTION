Description: A minimal R client for the 'OBS' WebSocket protocol
    ('obs-websocket' 5.x, <https://github.com/obsproject/obs-websocket>).
    This package provides low-level utilities to send requests and receive
    messages as raw JSON strings via WebSocket connections.
    It is designed for interactive use and does not attempt to abstract or
    validate 'OBS' request semantics.
