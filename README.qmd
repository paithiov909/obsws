A simple client for the [OBS WebSocket server](https://github.com/obsproject/obs-websocket)
based on [R6](https://r6.r-lib.org/) and [websocket](https://github.com/rstudio/websocket) packages.

## Usage

This package relies on the websocket package, which requires an
interactive R session (or a running event loop).
Code examples in this README are illustrative and may not run
in non-interactive contexts such as RMarkdown or Quarto.

```r
{{< include "tools/smoke-test.R" >}}
```

This `d` object is a parsed response to the 'GetVersion' request.
It is something like this:

```{r}
d <- readRDS("tools/obs_get-version.rds")
str(d)
```
